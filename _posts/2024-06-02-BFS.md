너비 우선 탐색 알고리즘을 정리한다.

---

## 정의

BFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching a tree or graph. Starting form the root (or an arbitrary node in the case of a graph), it explores all the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on nodes at the next depth level.

---

## 주요 특징

### **1. Traversal Method**

- BFS uses a FIFO (First in, First Out) structure, typically implemented with **a queue**.

### **2. Exploration Strategy**

- It explores nodes level by level, visiting all neighbors at the current depth before moving to the next depth level.

### **3. Graph Types**

- It can be used for both directed and undirected graphs.

## 알고리즘 단계

### BFS 

1. **Initialization**
	1. **Start** at the root node (or any arbitrary node in the case of a graph).
	2. **Mark** the starting node as visited.
	3. **Enqueue** the starting node into the queue.
2. **Exploration**:
	1. If the queue is **not empty**:
		1. **Dequeue** a node from the queue, which is the current node.
	2. For each **unvisited adjacent nodes** of the current node:
		1. **Mark** the adjacent node as visited.
		2. **Enqueue** the adjacent node into the queue.
3. **Termination**: **Repeat** step 2 until all nodes are visited.


> Nodes are marked as visited before enqueuing, ensuring they are not enqueued more than once. This approach uses a queue for the BFS and a set to keep track of visited nodes.

### 반복문(Iterative)

```python
BFS(graph, start):
    create a queue Q
    mark start as visited
    enqueue start into S
    while Q is not empty:
        current = Q.dequeue()
        // You can add your processing code here
        for each neighbor of current:
            if neighbor is not visited:
                mark neighbor as visited
                enqueue neighbor into Q
```

### 1. 간단한 트리 구조

#### 문제

아래와 같은 트리에서 BFS 방식을 적용하여 탐색하시오. 탐색은 A 노드에서 시작한다.

```mermaid
graph TD
 A---B;
 A---C;
 B---D;
 B---E;
 C---F;
```

#### 풀이. Iterative approach

1. **Initialization**
- Start at node A
- Mark node A as visited
- Initialize a queue and enqueue node A into the queue
- Queue: [A]
- Visit-info: {A}

```mermaid
graph TD
 A---B;
 A---C;
 B---D;
 B---E;
 C---F;
 style A fill:#9370DB
```

2. **Step 1**
- Dequeue node A from the queue
- Process(A)
- Enqueue its unvisited adjacent nodes B and C into the queue (order may vary), marking them as visited
- Queue: [B, C]
- Visit-info: {A, B, C}

```mermaid
graph TD
 A---B;
 A---C;
 B---D;
 B---E;
 C---F;
 linkStyle 0,1 stroke:red
 style A fill:#9370DB, stroke:red
 style B fill:#9370DB
 style C fill:#9370DB
```

3. **Step 2**
- Dequeue node B from the queue
- Process(B)
- Enqueue its unvisited adjacent nodes D and E into the queue (order may vary), marking them as visited
- Queue: [C, D, E]
- Visit-info: {A, B, C, D, E}

```mermaid
graph TD
 A---B;
 A---C;

4. **Step 3**
- Dequeue node C from the queue
- Process(C)
- Enqueue its unvisited adjacent node F into the queue, marking it as visited.
- Queue: [D, E, F]
- Visit-info: {A, B, C, D, E, F}

5. **Step 4**
- Dequeue node D from the queue
- Process(D)
- Node D has no unvisited adjacent nodes to enqueue
- Queue: [E, F]
- Visit-info: {A, B, C, D, E, F}
