깊이 우선 탐색 알고리즘을 정리한다.

## 정의

DFS is an algorithm for traversing or searching a tree or graph. Starting from the root (or an arbitrary node in the case of a graph), it explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

---

## 주요 특징

### **1. Traversal Method**

- DFS uses a LIFO (Last in, First Out) structure, typically implemented with **a stack**, either explicitly (using **a stack data structure**) or implicitly (via **recursion**).

### **2. Exploration Strategy**

- It explores nodes and branches to the maximum depth of the structure before backtacking.

### **3. Graph Types**

- It can be used for both directed and undirected graphs.

## 알고리즘 단계

1. **Start** at the root node (or any arbitrary node in the case of a graph).
2. **Push** the current node onto the stack (or call the recursive function).
3. **Mark** the current node as visited.
4. **Visit** an adjacent unvisited node and repeat step 2.
5. **Backtrack** when no unvisited adjacent nodes are found by popping the stack (or returning from the recursive call) and check for unvisited nodes.
6. **Repeat** until all nodes are visited.

```python
DFS(graph, start):
    create a stack S
    push start onto S
    while S is not empty:
        current = S.pop()
        if current is not visited:
            mark current as visited
            for each neighbor of current:
                if neighbor is not visited:
                    push neighbor onto S	
```

### 재귀법(Recursive)

```python
DFS(graph, node):
    if node is not visited:
        mark node as visited
        for each neighbor of node:
            if neighbor is not visited:
                DFS(graph, neighbor)
```
